# ApplePicker
Apple Picker is a collection game from Chapter 29 of the the textbook "Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development: From Concept to Playable Game with Unity and C# (3rd Edition)" by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

In the game, an AppleTree moves back and forth dropping Apples that players attempt to catch with three Baskets. Each Apple that is caught by the player is worth 100 points. If the player misses one Apple, then all Apples on the screen disappear, the player loses one Basket, and the game continues. When all three Baskets have been lost, the game is over.
